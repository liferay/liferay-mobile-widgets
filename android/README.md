# Liferay Screens for Android

## Introduction

Liferay Screens for Android includes the component (*screenlets*) library and a sample project. In Liferay Screens, a screenlet is a visual component that is connected to Liferay Portal's functionality. Screenlets use a specific UI to handle input from the user and present information from the portal. This enables the app to receive user input, handle communication with the server, and present the user with the results.

Each screenlet is tied to one or more of [Liferay's remote services](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/accessing-services-remotely-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-05-en). When the screenlet needs to show information to the user, it relies on a *view*. View sets can be contributed by third parties and are fully pluggable, so you aren't limited to one specific look and feel. The Screens library provides the standard *Default* view set and the sample *Material* view set.

To learn about the architecture of Screens for Android, see the [library documentation page.](library/README.md).

## Requirements

Development of Android apps using Liferay Screens requires the following: 

- Android Studio 1.0.2 or above
- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 14) or above
- [Liferay Portal 6.2 CE or EE](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases)
- [Liferay Screens' compatibility plugin](http://www.liferay.com/es/marketplace/-/mp/application/54365664) (or [EE](http://www.liferay.com/es/marketplace/-/mp/application/54369726) version)

## Compatibility

Liferay Screens for Android is compatible with Android 4.0 (API Level 14) and higher. The SDK uses the [AppCompat library](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-appcompat) (v7:22.1.1) to offer a material look on older devices and the new [recycler view](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-recyclerview) implementation.

Other internal dependencies are:

- [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) 
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)

## Preparing Your Project for Liferay Screens

Liferay Screens is released as an [AAR file](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/aar-format) that is currently hosted in jCenter. The following sections describe how to set up Screens with Gradle and Maven. While instructions are also provided for manual setup, it's strongly recommended that you use Maven or Gradle to set and download your dependencies.

To include your first screenlet, you only need to follow 3 steps:

* Download and include Liferay Screens in your project.
* Configure your server's IP address and Company ID.
* Add a screenlet to your view.

The following sections show you how to download and include Liferay Screens in your project.

### Gradle

Use the following steps to configure your project with Gradle:

1. Add jCenter to your repositories:

	```groovy
	repositories {
		jcenter()
	}
	```

2. Include the SDK as a dependency:

	```groovy
	dependencies {
		compile 'com.liferay.mobile:liferay-screens:1.0.+'
	}
	```

Gradle downloads all the necessary dependencies before building your project. If you get errors such as `Duplicate files copied in APK META-INF/NOTICE` when building with Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
	...
	packagingOptions {	
		exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
		exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
	}
	...
}
```

### Maven

Use the following steps to configure your project with Maven:

1. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

	```xml
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.liferay.mobile</groupId>
	    <artifactId>liferay-screens</artifactId>
	    <version>LATEST</version>
	</dependency>
	```

2. Force a Maven update to download all the dependencies.

Note that if Maven can't locate the artifact, you need to add jCenter as a new repository in your maven settings (`.m2/settings.xml`):

```xml
<profiles>
	<profile>
		<repositories>
			<repository>
				<id>bintray-liferay-liferay-mobile</id>
				<name>bintray</name>
				<url>http://dl.bintray.com/liferay/liferay-mobile</url>
			</repository>
		</repositories>
		<pluginRepositories>
			<pluginRepository>
				<id>bintray-liferay-liferay-mobile</id>
				<name>bintray-plugins</name>
				<url>http://dl.bintray.com/liferay/liferay-mobile</url>
			</pluginRepository>
		</pluginRepositories>
		<id>bintray</id>
	</profile>
</profiles>
<activeProfiles>
	<activeProfile>bintray</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
```

### Manually

If you're using Gradle, you can also use the SDK sources manually:

1. [Download](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/releases) the
latest version of Liferay Screens for Android.

2. Copy the contents of `Android/library` in a folder next to your project.

3. Configure a `settings.gradle` file in your project with the paths to the library folders:

	```groovy
	include ':core'
	project(':core').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../../library/core')
	project(':core').name = 'liferay-screens'
	```

4. Include the required dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

	```groovy
	compile project(':liferay-screens')
	```
	
You can also configure the `.aar` binary files (in `Android/dist`) as local `.aar` dependencies. You can download all the necessary files from [jCenter](https://bintray.com/liferay/liferay-mobile/liferay-screens/view).

Great! Your project should now be ready for Liferay Screens. You can do a quick check by compiling and executing a blank activity and importing a Liferay Screens class (like `LoginScreenlet`).

Next, you'll learn how to configure the IP address and other required parameters.

## Configuring Your Project to Communicate with Your Liferay Installation

Regardless of how you install Screens in your project, you need to configure it to communicate with your Liferay installation. You could have the greatest app in existence, but if it can't communicate with your Liferay installation then it's all for naught. Fortunately, setting this up is a simple task. In your project's `res/values` directory, create a new file called `server_context.xml`.

Add the following code to the new file:

```xml
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<resources>
	<!-- Change these values for your Liferay Portal installation -->

	<string name="liferay_server">http://10.0.2.2:8080</string>

	<integer name="liferay_company_id">10155</integer>
	<integer name="liferay_group_id">10182</integer>

	</resources>
```

As the comment indicates, make sure to change these values to match those in your Liferay installation. The server address `http://10.0.2.2:8080` is suitable for testing with Android Studio's emulator, because it corresponds to `localhost:8080` through the emulator.

You should note that there are additional properties you can configure in `server_context.xml`, depending on the screenlets in your project. For example, you can add the following two properties if you're using `DDLFormScreenlet` and `DDLListScreenlet` to interact with DDLs in your app. You can see an additional example `server_context.xml` file [here](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros/src/main/res/values/server_context.xml).

```xml
	<!-- Change these values for your Liferay Portal installation -->

	<integer name="liferay_recordset_id">20935</integer>
	<string name="liferay_recordset_fields">Title</string>
```

Super! Your Android project should now be ready for Liferay Screens.

## Using Screenlets

Now that your project is configured to use Screens, you can start using screenlets. First, insert a screenlet in your activity or fragment layout. You can do this in XML or with the visual layout editor in Android Studio.

![Insert a screenlet.](documentation/images/insert_screenlet.png)

Next, set the screenlet's attributes in its XML tag. Refer to the screenlet documentation to see the attributes each screenlet supports:

![Set the screenlet attributes.](documentation/images/set_attributes.png)

You now need to configure your app to listen for the events the screenlet produces. To do this, implement the listener interface associated with the screenlet in your activity or fragment class. For example, for the `LoginScreenlet` you need to implement the `LoginListener` interface. Then set your activity or fragment as the screenlet's listener:

![Implement listener in your activity](documentation/images/implement_listener.png)

Awesome! Now you know how to use screenlets in your app. Next, the screenlets available in Screens for Android are listed.

## Listing of Available Screenlets

Screenlets are grouped in modules based on internal dependencies. Each module is isolated, so you can use only the modules that are necessary for your project. The modules are listed here with their screenlets.

- **Auth**: Module for user authentication. It uses the [user management](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/user-management) features of Liferay Portal. It includes the following screenlets:

	- [`LoginScreenlet`](documentation/LoginScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to sign users into a Liferay instance.
	- [`SignUpScreenlet`](documentation/SignUpScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to sign new users into a Liferay instance.
	- [`ForgotPasswordScreenlet`](documentation/ForgotPasswordScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to send emails containing a new password or password reset link to users.
	- [`UserPortraitScreenlet`](documentation/UserPortraitScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to show the user's portrait picture.

- **Dynamic Data Lists (DDL)**: Module for interacting with [Dynamic Data Lists](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-web-forms-and-dynamic-data-lists) in a Liferay instance. It includes the following screenlets:

	- [`DDLFormScreenlet`](documentation/DDLFormScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to present dynamic forms to be filled out by users and submitted back to the server.
	- [`DDLListScreenlet`](documentation/DDLListScreenlet.md): Gives your app the ability to show a list of records based on a pre-existing DDL in a Liferay instance.

Also, some screenlets are not part of a specific package:

- [`AssetListScreenlet`](documentation/AssetListScreenlet.md): Shows a list of assets managed by [Liferay's Asset Framework](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/asset-framework-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-06-en). This includes web content, blog entries, documents, users and more.
- [`WebContentDisplayScreenlet`](Documentation/WebContentDisplayScreenlet.md): Shows the HTML of web content. This screenlet uses the features available in [Web Content Management](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/web-content-management).

## Listing of Available Views

With view sets, you can control the look and feel of any screenlet in your app. These views are also fully pluggable. This means you can change the UI and UX of your app by installing new view sets to extend and customize any screenlet.

The view sets currently released with Liferay Screens for Android are:

- **Default**: The standard view set used when you include any screenlet in your activity or fragment and don't change the value of the `liferay:layoutId` attribute. This view can be used as the parent view for any custom views (refer to the [Architecture Guide](documentation/architecture.md#view-layer) for more details on this).
- **Material**: A sample view set intended to demonstrate how to develop your own view sets from scratch. For information on creating your own view sets, refer to the [Views Guide](documentation/views.md).
- **Westeros**: A custom view set created to customize the behavior and appearance of the [Westeros Bank](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liferay.mobile.screens.bankofwesteros) demo application.

## Examples Using Liferay Screens

There are two demo applications already using Liferay Screens:

- [test-app](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/test-app): a showcase of all the currently available screenlets.
- [Westeros Bank](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros): a real example using some screenlets to manage technical issues for the *Westeros Bank*. It's also available in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liferay.mobile.screens.bankofwesteros).
