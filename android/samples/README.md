# Liferay Screens for Android Samples

This directory contains sample apps that demonstrate Liferay Screens for Android. You can refer to these apps, along with the [Liferay Screens for Android documentation](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/android-apps-with-liferay-screens), to see how Screenlets and Views are used. 

## The Add Bookmark Screenlet

The Add Bookmark Screenlet lets you add bookmarks to the Bookmarks portlet in 
Liferay Portal. It's developed in [this tutorial](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-android-screenlets) as an example of creating your own Screenlet.

## The Westeros Bank App

The [Westeros Bank app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AroTd6zI794) is a real-world example that uses Screenlets to manage technical issues for the *Westeros Bank*. This example app demonstrates how to use Screenlets in a real-world app, and how to extend and customize standard Screenlets and View Sets to meet your design requirements.

## The Push Notifications app

The Push Notifications app uses the [push portlet](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/48439053) and Liferay Portal to show global notifications and refresh the list each time a DDL record is added in the portal.

See the push notifications [tutorial](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-liferay-push-in-android-apps) 
for more information.

## The Test App

The Test app uses all available screenlets. It also lets you change some configuration parameters to modify its behavior and appearance.
