## Requirements

- XCode 6.0 or above
- iOS 8 SDK
- Liferay Portal 6.2 CE or EE
- Mobile Widgets plugin installed

## Portal configuration

### Authentication method
Note that the authentication method configured in the portal can be different than the used in this widget. You may want to allow users to remember their password providing their email address but the authentication method could be based on screen name. This would lead to inconsistent configurations and should be avoided.

### Password reset
Depending on portal configuration `Control Panel - Portal Settings - Authentication`, the forgot password feature could be enabled or not.

- If both options are unchecked, this feature will be disabled.
- If both options are checked, an email with reset link will be sent
- If first option is checked and second one is unchecked, an email with new password will be sent.

Refer to [Configuring Portal Settings](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/portal-settings-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-16-en) section for more details.


### Anonymous request
This request is done without the user being logged in, but authentication is needed to call the API. It's recommended that the portal administrator creates a specific user with minimal permissions in order to allow this operation.

## Delegate

ForgotPasswordWidget delegates some event in an object that conforms `ForgotPasswordWidgetDelegate` protocol.
This protocol allows to implement the following methods:

- `onForgotPasswordResponse(boolean)`: called when email was successfully sent. The boolean parameter indicates whether a new password was generated or a reset link was sent.
- `onForgotPasswordError(error)`: called when an error happened in the process. The NSError object describing the error occurred.
